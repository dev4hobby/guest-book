# Serverless Framework Python Flask API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to develop and deploy a simple Python Flask API service running on AWS Lambda using the traditional Serverless Framework.

## Anatomy of the template

This template configures a single function, `api`, which is responsible for handling all incoming requests thanks to configured `http` events. To learn more about `http` event configuration options, please refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/). As the events are configured in a way to accept all incoming requests, `Flask` framework is responsible for routing and handling requests internally. The implementation takes advantage of `serverless-wsgi`, which allows you to wrap WSGI applications such as Flask apps. To learn more about `serverless-wsgi`, please refer to corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/logandk/serverless-wsgi). Additionally, the template relies on `serverless-python-requirements` plugin for packaging dependencies from `requirements.txt` file. For more details about `serverless-python-requirements` configuration, please refer to corresponding [GitHub repository](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).

## Usage

### Prerequisites

```bash
python3.8 -m venv ./venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

### Deployment

This example is made to work with the Serverless Framework dashboard, which includes advanced features such as CI/CD, monitoring, metrics, etc.

In order to deploy with dashboard, you need to first login with:

```
serverless login
```

install dependencies with:

```
npm install
```

and

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

and then perform deployment with:

```
serverless deploy
```

### Local development

Thanks to capabilities of `serverless-wsgi`, it is also possible to run your application locally, however, in order to do that, you will need to first install `werkzeug` dependency, as well as all other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`. It is recommended to use a dedicated virtual environment for that purpose. You can install all needed dependencies with the following commands:

```bash
pip install werkzeug
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point, you can run your application locally with the following command:

```bash
IS_OFFLINE=True
serverless wsgi serve
```
